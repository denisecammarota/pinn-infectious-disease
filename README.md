# Tutorials on Physics Inspired Neural Networks (PINNs) for Infectious Disease dynamics

This repository is intended to be a collection of tutorials on how to use Physics Inspired Neural Networks (PINNs) for understanding infectious disease dynamics, using deterministic compartmental models. 

## Contents
The main contents of this tutorial are Notebooks 1 to 6, which contain:
- Notebook 1: A comparison between PINNs and regular neural networks when approximating the one-dimensional susceptible-infected (SI) model. First PINN implementation.
- Notebook 2: Explaining the concept of collocation points for PINNs. Improving our first example.
- Notebook 3: Example of parameter inference using simulated data with the SI model.
- Notebook 4: Solving the SIR model with PINNs. First example with a system of ODEs.
- Notebook 5: Example of parameter inference using the influenza in a boarding school 1978 outbreak. 
Complementary files include the <code>neuralnet.py</code> file, which contains the basic NN structure used throughout this tutorial, the influenza in 1978 dataset and a References notebook.
